# ptar TODO

* Implement decompress in ptar: GNU tar chokes on errors when multiple processes are extracting to the same tree.
* Skip making the first (empty) archive. Can lazily create the archive file.
* Write initial README.
    * Write build instructions
    * Write bench instructions
    * Show basic benchmarks output
